"""Orchestrator service — assembles a project's parts into one lifecycle (SPEC C1).

A Project bundles: workspace (from the warm template), a Vite supervisor (live preview), a
ModelControl (per-project switching state), and an EnforcementShim (routes model calls through
the gateway with the sovereign override). Per D9 a container hosts exactly one project, bound to
the Domino project's mounted volume and attached lazily on first use.

Deep module, narrow interface: project / build / build_stream / shutdown.
